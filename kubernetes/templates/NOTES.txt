Thank you for installing the HDFS CSI plugin!

The HDFS CSI plugin is now successfully deployed on your Kubernetes cluster.

### Verifying the Deployment
1. Check the status of the HDFS CSI components:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
   ```

2. View logs from the CSI Controller (Deployment):
   ```
   kubectl logs -l app=hdfs-csi-plugin -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
   ```

3. For Node-specific operations (if a DaemonSet is used), view logs:
   ```
   kubectl logs -l app=hdfs-node-plugin -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
   ```

### Post-Installation Usage
- To validate the CSI Driver is registered, run:
  ```
  kubectl get csidrivers.storage.k8s.io
  ```

- Verify volume attachment and lifecycle operations:
  - Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) associated with this driver.
  - Ensure the PVC is bound correctly and accessible to your workloads.

### Important Notes
- **CSI Endpoint**: The CSI gRPC server listens on the endpoint `unix:///csi/csi.sock`.
- If you encounter any issues, please refer to the Kubernetes CSI logs and documentation for troubleshooting.

For further details and operational documentation, refer to the official repository or contact the project maintainers.
